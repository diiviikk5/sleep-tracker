I just needed something simple and effective. Now, I can actually see how sleep affects me and make small changes instead of guessing.

If my sleep sucks, this app calls me out. If I need to fix it, it helps me do that in a fun way.

This was built for personal use, but if you're also tired of feeling tired, give it a try 

1️ Tracks My Sleep
Every day, I enter how many hours I slept. The app keeps a record of the past 7 days and shows me if I’m consistent or if my sleep is a mess.

2️ Calculates Sleep Debt 
Turns out, when you don’t sleep enough, you build up sleep debt—and it doesn’t just go away. This app shows me how bad my sleep deficit is so I know how much I need to recover.

3️ Predicts Fatigue Risk ⚠
It even estimates how much my reaction time and focus get worse because of sleep loss (not just vibes, actual numbers). If my fatigue risk is too high, I know I’m pushing my limits.

4️ Recovery Plan 
Instead of just saying “sleep more,” it gives me a realistic plan to fix my sleep debt over the next few days.

5️ Spin-the-Wheel Sleep Challenge 
If I mess up my sleep, I don’t just ignore it. I spin a random challenge to help reset my habits. Could be something simple like:
No screens 30 minutes before bed
Stretching before sleeping
Reading a book instead of doom-scrolling

6️ A Cool Loading Screen 
Every time I open the app, I get a random sleep-related fact while it loads. No boring buffering screens here.
